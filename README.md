# task-board
This is a task board to keep up with the statuses of inputted tasks.


## Description
The task board is meant for a user to add tasks, set their completion status, and finally delete tasks from the board upon completion.
The motivation for this project was for me to work on different functions in JS. This is not a completed work but it will be in time.


## Usage

Start by clicking 'Add Task' and then add your task to the board.
